This script is a custom trading indicator for TradingView that combines the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify potential buy and sell signals. It plots bullish and bearish reversal signals based on RSI levels and includes a 200-period EMA for trend analysis. The indicator helps traders make informed decisions by highlighting key reversal points and providing visual cues on the chart, along with generating alerts for significant market movements.
